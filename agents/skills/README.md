# LiteRT-LM Agent Skills

This directory contains specialized agent skills that guide AI developers to
successfully orchestrate, implement, and verify complex development tasks in the
LiteRT-LM ecosystem.

## Installation

To register and automatically load any of these skills in your agent sessions:

1.  **Locate your agent's skills directory** (the folder where your agent loads
    custom instructions or skills).

2.  **Copy the desired skill folder**
    (e.g., `create-litert-lm-android-demo-app`) from this directory into that
    skills directory:

    ```bash
    # Replace the destination path with your active agent skills directory
    cp -r agents/skills/create-litert-lm-android-demo-app /path/to/your/agent/skills/
    ```

3.  Once copied, the agent will automatically detect and load the skill when
    resolving related user requests.

## Available Skills

*   **`create-litert-lm-android-demo-app`**: Guides the agent to implement,
    build, and package a standalone LiteRT-LM Android demo application with
    backend selection and multi-modality support using Bazel 9.

## Usage

To trigger a skill, instruct the agent under your active session with a prompt
specifying the parameters of the target task. The agent will recognize the
matching skill files and automatically follow the defined execution process.

### Example Prompt (LiteRT-LM Android Demo App)

To execute the specific LiteRT-LM Android demo application creation skill, use
this trigger prompt format:

```text
Please create a LiteRT-LM Android demo app

root: ~/litert_lm_litert_lm_maven_integration

Target: pixel 10
model: gemma 4
```
