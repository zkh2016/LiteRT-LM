   * By default, this API converts Kotlin camelCase names to snake_case to potentially improve tool

   * significant for smaller, fine-tuned models that were trained exclusively with one convention.
   *
   * Set this flag to `false` if your model is specifically trained with camelCase tool descriptions
   * to skip the conversion. Otherwise, the default of `true` (using snake_case) is recommended.
