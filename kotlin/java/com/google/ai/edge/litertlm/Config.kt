/**
 * Configuration for repetition penalty.
 *
 * When multiple penalties are configured and active, the order of application to output logits
 * during decoding is:
 * 1. Multiplicative penalty ([repetitionPenalty])
 * 2. Subtractive penalties ([presencePenalty] and [frequencyPenalty])
 *
 * @property repetitionPenalty A multiplicative penalty applied to a token's logit if that token has
 *   appeared at least once inside the generated window history (e.g., 1.0 = no penalty, 1.2 =
 *   moderate penalty). Positive logits are divided by this parameter, and negative logits are
 *   multiplied (HuggingFace style). Must be >= 1.0f; values less than 1.0f are automatically
 *   clamped to 1.0f during execution. Defaults to 1.0f when `null`.
 * @property presencePenalty A scalar subtracted from a token's logit if that token has appeared at
 *   least once inside the generated window history. Positive values discourage repetition, while
 *   negative values reward repeating tokens (OpenAI style). Defaults to 0.0f when `null`.
 * @property frequencyPenalty A scalar subtracted from a token's logit, scaled linearly by the
 *   number of times that token has previously appeared inside the generated window history.
 *   Positive values discourage repetition, while negative values reward repeating tokens (OpenAI
 *   style). Defaults to 0.0f when `null`.
 * @property windowSize The maximum number of recent tokens in generation history to consider when
 *   computing penalization. Tokens generated prior to this window are forgotten. A value of 0 means
 *   tracking all infinite generation history. Must be >= 0; negative values are clamped to 0 during
 *   execution. Defaults to 0 when `null`.

 *   to 0. If [windowSize] is greater than 0 but less than [noRepeatNgramSize], it is automatically
 *   clamped to [noRepeatNgramSize] during execution so that the ngrams can fit and be tracked.
